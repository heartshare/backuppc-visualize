* BackupPC Backup Duration Visualization

** Purpose

A graphical view of when each backup ran and how long it took gives us
excellent insight into what is going on with the backup schedules,
allowing us to see the problem hosts and problem time periods, to
better tweak the system so that every host gets backed up every 24
hours or less.


** Resources

Gnuplot turns out to be very unsuited to the task.  It can't do
horizontal bar graphs at all, and it can't really do broken-bar
graphs without a real kludge.  Ploticus handles it very well,
including varying the color based on a field in the data record.

** Wishlist

+ [ ] alternate wide, light gray bars to mark full days

+ [ ] print backup numbers on time bar

+ [X] color time bar differently for full vs incr

+ [X] plot multiple backups per host
